🚀 POC Report: Transformer-Based Sequence Analysis for Customer Interaction Prediction

1️⃣ Introduction

This Proof of Concept (POC) explores the use of a Transformer-based model to analyze customer journeys and predict whether an interaction occurs at some point in the sequence.
By modeling the sequence of steps a customer takes, we can:
✅ Identify patterns in customer journeys
✅ Generate contextual embeddings for downstream applications
✅ Help businesses optimize user experiences

2️⃣ Problem Statement

Customers follow different paths while interacting with a product or service.
Some journeys result in an interaction (Step 51), while others end without interaction (Step 182).

Our goal is to train a sequence model that takes a customer journey as input and predicts whether an interaction will occur.
Additionally, we extract contextual embeddings that encode journey characteristics.

3️⃣ Dataset Creation – The Most Crucial Step

Understanding the Customer Journey

A customer’s journey is represented as a sequence of steps they take over time.
Each step consists of:

Step ID: Represents the action taken (e.g., browsing, adding items to cart).

Duration: Time taken before moving to the next step.


Key Rules for Dataset Construction

📌 Step 51 is not included in the input sequence to prevent target leakage.
📌 If Step 51 is present, we split the sequence at that point and set target = 1.
📌 If Step 51 is absent, the sequence must end with Step 182, and we set target = 0.

Example 1: Journey With Interaction (Target = 1)

(Target = 1 because Step 51 was encountered and removed)

Example 2: Journey Without Interaction (Target = 0)

(Target = 0 because Step 51 was never encountered)

Why Is This Crucial?

⚠️ Incorrect dataset construction can cause data leakage, leading to misleading results.
✅ By carefully handling Step 51, we ensure the model learns from the journey itself, not the presence of an interaction.

Key Components Explained Simply

📌 Embedding Layer
🔹 Converts Step IDs into meaningful numeric representations.
🔹 Transforms duration values into the same space.

📌 Positional Encoding
🔹 Adds temporal context (since order matters).
🔹 Ensures model understands sequence dependencies.

📌 Transformer Encoder
🔹 Captures relationships between steps in the journey.
🔹 Helps detect patterns that lead to interaction or dropout.

📌 Final Classification Layer
🔹 Uses learned journey representation to predict interaction likelihood.

📌 Embedding Extraction
🔹 Generates vector representations for downstream analytics.
